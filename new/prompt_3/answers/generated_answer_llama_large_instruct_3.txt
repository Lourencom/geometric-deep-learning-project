Explanation:

The task is to create a query that generates the output based on the input. The pattern of the output seems to be repeating the digits in pairs, with each pair being repeated twice.

Here's how you can solve this problem using Python:

```Python
def generate_output(a, b):
    return [str(int(str(a) * 2)), str(int(str(b) * 2))]

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(' '.join(generate_output(a, b)))
```

This program takes two integers as inputs and returns their doubled values as strings, separated by spaces. For example, if `a` is 86 and `b` is 64, it will print "868686 646464". If `a` is 79 and `b` is 43, it will print "797979 434343", etc. 

You can run this code multiple times for different inputs to see its functionality. Just replace the numbers at the end (`a = int(input())`, `b = int(input())`) with your desired inputs.
