We could almost field a full baseball team. But the Flynns, they could put an entire football lineup on a snowy field at Thanksgiving, with reserves. My mother agonized over what to do. She was devout, though starting to read progressive Catholic magazines like Commonweal, which published the essays of Hannah Arendt and the poetry of W.H. Auden. We loved Robert F. Kennedyâ€™s family: 11 kids, and Ethel looks great. Bobby himself was the seventh of nine. Of course, they had money, so it looked glamorous.\nQ: The author believes his family could fill a team of which sport?",

Having 170 extra knockback distance and the 25 extra cast range is kinda a big deal. This is probably why Poppy isn't doing well in the games she's playing. She only has 300 range to stun people. That's pathetically easy to avoid. How can Poppy properly do her job if she's going to have inferior abilities to start out with? Why do people not really have to care about positioning when fighting poppy as much as vayne? Leaves a bad taste in my mouth really.\nQuestion 1: Which person is performing better in the game?\nQuestion 2: Which person is not performing better in the game?\nQuestion 3: What move does Vayne use to stun ememies?\nQuestion 4: What is Poppy's move that is used to stun enemies?",
